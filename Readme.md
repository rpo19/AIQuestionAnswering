# Question Answering: Structured vs Unstructured

This project is for the master course of Artificial Intelligence from Universit√† Milano Bicocca.

The project aims to explore and compare open domain question answering approaches over both structured (Knowledge Graph) and unstructured data (Free-text), using respectively DBPedia and Wikipedia as information sources. A prototype of both types of approaches has been implemented. This has highlighted the issues and complexities behind the implementation of a QA system in a real-world scenario. To understand the pros and cons of the implemented approaches different kinds of evaluation have been performed.

To know more about the project look at the [Presentation.pdf](Presentation.pdf)

# Directory structure
```
demo # demo interface
knowledgeGraph # knowledge graph QA
text # free text QA
evaluation # evaluation script to compare the two approaches
data # create this folder and put models there
```

# Run the demo
The demo loads both the Graph based and the Free text QA therefore requires much memory.

## With docker (suggested)
Install docker and docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), then:
```
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
# some time is required at first start to download models
```
Now open [http://localhost](http://localhost) and you should access QA demo.

## Install python requirements
The project has been developed on python3.8

- Create a virtualenv (suggested)
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    and activate it
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate # linux
    # or for windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
- Install requirements
    ```
    pip install -r demo/backend/requirements.txt
    pip install -r knowledgeGraph/kgqalib/requirements.txt
    pip install -r text/ftqalib/requirements.txt
    ```
- Download required models/data
    - spacy:
        ```
        python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
        ```
    - nltk stopwords
        ```
        python -c 'import nltk;nltk.download("stopwords")'
        ```
    - Glove embeddings in gensim format; download from [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wHP5tHvBiG5aHuCHxotYQYLeQxRKI-gm/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wHP5tHvBiG5aHuCHxotYQYLeQxRKI-gm/view?usp=sharing) and save in `data/glove.840B.300d.gensim`
    - Pretrained pattern classifier; download from [https://drive.google.com/file/d/14OtRDFrT-mAEDSqBX7dQKJGAG39xPd7c/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14OtRDFrT-mAEDSqBX7dQKJGAG39xPd7c/view?usp=sharing) and save in `data/models/pattern_classifier.h5`

- Run the backend with
    ```
    python demo/backend/server.py
    ```
    The first run will download some required models.
    Then backend will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

- Download pre-built frontend from [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UwBqODTaZyRMZW2HrPVRQBqHe-KU1ssL/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UwBqODTaZyRMZW2HrPVRQBqHe-KU1ssL/view?usp=sharing), unzip it and then serve it for instance with
    ```
    cd frontend
    python -m http.server 4200
    ```
    (port 4200 should be already in backend CORS origin as it is the default angularJS development server port)
